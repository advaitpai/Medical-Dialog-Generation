ANOMALOUS OBSERVATION (by ZOHAIR):
1. In one of the responses (#59 sorted desc) - response suggests to visit a specific hospital in Bangalore, where the patients questions about suggestions on visiting a particular hospital in Bangalore. Using the contexts, the system came up with a suggestion, which seems good to me in terms of making suggestions which are note specifically relating to one's health.
